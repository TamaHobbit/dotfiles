# Tips from Michael Lerch: http://www.mdlerch.com/emailing-mutt-and-vim-advanced-config.html

# First, let's talk about format flowed text. Perhaps you believe so strongly in
# 72 character width emails that you tend to enforce this philosophy on everyone
# you email. If you are a more reasonable person, you prefer 72 characters for
# writing and in some circumstances reading, but certainly not while reading on a
# phone, for example. The solution to this is format flow text.
#
# Essentially, any line that ends in white space is continued on the next line
# and any line that ends not on white space terminates a paragraph. Hence, email
# clients that respect format flow treat any newlines preceded by a space a soft
# return and any preceded by a non-space a hard return.
#
# To use this in mutt and vim, we first have to turn on format flow in mutt so
# that it puts a flag in the email header.
#
# Unfortunately, I found that thunderbird ignores the flowed text, so I'm not doing this
# set text_flowed
